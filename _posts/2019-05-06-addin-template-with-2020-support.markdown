Hey, it has been a long time since my last post [about .NET (Blazor + Visual Studio issue)](/dotnet/2019/02/17/blazor-cannot-identify-bin-folder).

This time I would like to share an updated version of the awesome Revit add-in template [I have created a while ago](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/07/vacation-and-multi-version-revit-add-in-template.html#2).

Among other things this release includes:

* **Revit 2020** support
* the ability to **build & debug** one add-in at time
* binded new events
* simplified Revit SDK NuGet dependencies
* improved and simplified Ribbon management:
  * tab and panel management
  * the ability to use custom availability classes

I would 💖 **LOVE** 😍 to have some feedback from the community. Please use [project's issues](https://github.com/Equipple/vs-templates-revit-addin/issues) or by using [my contact details](/about-me).
